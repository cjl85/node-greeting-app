1) What is a Node module?

A Node module is a set of functions to include in your application. You can consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.

2)What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

exports - A reference to module.exports. Any reassignment of  exports will not be available outside of the module.

module.exports - The variable that gets returned from require(). It is an empty object by default, and it can be reassigned to anything.

3)Why is using exports recommended?

Using exports is recommended unless you are planning on having your module be a specific object type.

This is generally the simplest way to export a module unless you need specificity.
